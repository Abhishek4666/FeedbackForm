# Feedback Form - React Application

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly feedback form using React. This form allows users to provide their feedback on various aspects such as overall experience, ease of use, and features. The feedback collected can be used to improve the user experience and functionality of the application.

## Design

The design of the application is simple and intuitive. The form includes fields for the user's name, email, phone number, overall experience, ease of use, features, and comments. Each field includes validation to ensure that the user's input is correct and complete.

## Technical Details

This application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The state of each form field is managed using React's useState hook, which allows the application to re-render whenever the state changes.

The form includes a handleSubmit function that is called when the form is submitted. This function prevents the default form submission, validates the form fields, and then resets the form fields back to their initial values.

Form validation is implemented using a combination of HTML5 validation attributes (such as required and type) and custom validation logic in the handleSubmit function.

The application also includes a reset function that is called to reset all the form fields back to their initial values. This function is called after the form is successfully submitted.

The application is styled using CSS. The CSS is kept in a separate file and imported into the React component to keep the styling separate from the logic of the application.

The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements for this application could include adding more form fields, implementing more complex form validation, and integrating with a backend to store the feedback data.
